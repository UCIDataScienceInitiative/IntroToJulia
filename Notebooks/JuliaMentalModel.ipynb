    "- Another significant group are the machine learning and statistics users from R/Python looking to solve the \"two-language\" problem.\n",
    "- Another group (a lot of Base contributors) are C/Fortran developers who are looking to increase productivity without sacrificing speed.\n",
    "- Another group are \"general-purpose\" users: using Julia to develop faster web frameworks, compilers, and anyting else you can think of! \n",
    "- Another group is from functional programming languages (Haskell) and Lisps (Clojure, Femtolisp) interested in Julia's metaprogramming and parallelism.\n",

    "We want a language that’s open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.\n",

We want the power without the layers of impenetrable complexity. We want to write simple scalar loops that compile down to tight machine code using just the registers on a single CPU. We want to write A*B and launch a thousand computations on a thousand machines, calculating a vast matrix product together."
