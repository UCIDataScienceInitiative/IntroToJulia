    "  - Lets a single instruction calculate multiple things at the same time\n",
    "  - Ex: Multiple multiplications in one CPU instruction\n",
    "- Threads\n",
    "  - Shared Memory Parallelism\n",
    "  - Small overhead, most share the same memory (multicore processors)\n",
    "- Processes\n",
    "  - Overhead is much higher\n",
