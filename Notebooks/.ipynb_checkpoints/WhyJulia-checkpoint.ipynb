    "# Why Does Julia Work So Well?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an obvious reason to choose Julia:\n",
    "\n",
    ">it's faster than other scripting languages, allowing you to have the rapid development of Python/MATLAB/R while producing code that is as fast as C/Fortran\n",
    "\n",
    "Newcomers to Julia might be a little wary of that statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why not just make other scripting languages faster? If Julia can do it, why can't others? \n",
    "2. How do you interpert Julia benchmarks to confirm this? (This is surprisingly difficult for many!)\n",
    "2. That sounds like it violates the No-Free-Lunch heuristic. Is there really nothing lost?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people believe Julia is fast **because it is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled** (i.e. every statement is run using compiled functions which are either compiled right before they are used, or cached compilations from before). This leads to questions about what Julia gives over JIT'd implementations of Python/R (and MATLAB by default uses a JIT). These JIT compilers have been optimized for far longer than Julia, so why should we be crazy and believe that somehow Julia quickly out-optimized all of them? However, that is a complete misunderstanding of Julia. What I want show, in a very visual way, is that Julia is fast because of its design decisions. The core design decision, **type-stability through specialization via multiple-dispatch** is what allows Julia to be very easy for a compiler to make into efficient code, but also allow the code to be very concise and \"look like a scripting language\". This will lead to some very clear performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some \"lunches lost\" that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the difference, we only need to go as far as basic math."

A `Vector{Float64}` is the same memory layout as an array of doubles in C, both making interop with C easy (indeed, in some sense \"Julia is a layer on top of C\") and it leads to high performance (the same is true for NumPy arrays).\n",

    "## Type-stability and Code Introspection\n",
    "\n",
    "Type stability is the idea that there is only 1 possible type which can be outputtted from a method. For example, the reasonable type to output from `*(::Float64,::Float64)` is a `Float64`. No matter what you give it, it will spit out a `Float64`. This right here is multiple-dispatch: the `*` operator calls a different method depending on the types that it sees. When it sees floats, it will spit out floats. Julia provides code introspection macros so that way you can see what your code actually compiles to. Thus Julia is not just a scripting language, it's a scripting language which lets you deal with assembly! Julia, like many languages, compiles to LLVM (LLVM is a type of portable assembly language)."

    "# Core Idea: Multiple Dispatch + Type Stability => Speed + Readibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Type stability is one crucial feature which separates Julia apart from other scripting languages.  In fact, the core idea of Julia is the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple dispatch allows for a language to dispatch function calls onto type-stable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what Julia is all about, so let's take some time to dig into it.If you have type stability inside of a function (meaning, any function call within the function is also type-stable), then the compiler can know the types of the variables at every step. Therefore it can compile the function with the full amount of optimizations since at this point the code is essentially the same as C/Fortran code.  Multiple-dispatch works into this story because it means that `*` can be a type-stable function: it just means different things for different inputs. But if the compiler can know the types of `a` and `b` before calling `*`, then it knows which `*` method to use, and therefore it knows the output type of `c=a*b`. Thus it can propogate the type information all the way down, knowing all of the types along the way, allowing for full optimiziations. Multiple dispatch allows `*` to mean the \"right thing\" every time you use it, almost magically allowing this optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things we learn from this. For one, in order to achieve this level of optimization, you must have type-stability. This is not featured in the standard libraries of most languages, and was choice that was made to make the experience a little easier for users. Secondly, multiple dispatch was required to be able to specialize the functions for types which allows for the scripting language syntax to be \"more explicit than meets the eye\". Lastly, a robust type system is required. In order to build the type-unstable exponentiation (which may be needed) we needed functionalities like convert. Thus the language must be designed to be type-stable with multiple dispatch and centered around a robust type system in order to achieve this raw performance while maintaining the syntax/ease-of-use of a scripting language. You can put a JIT on Python, but to really make it Julia, you would have to design it to be Julia."

    "## The Julia Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julia benchmarks, featured on [the Julia website](http://julialang.org/), test components of the programming language for speed. **This doesn't mean it's testing the fastest implemention**. That is where a major misconception occurs. You'll have an R programmer look at the R code for the Fibonacci calculator and say \"wow, that's terrible R code. You're not supposed to use recursion in R. Of course it's slow\". However, the Fibonacci problem is designed to test recursion, not the fastest implementation to the the ith Fibonacci number. The other problems are the same way: testing basic components of the langauge to see how fast they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is built up using multiple-dispatch on type-stable functions. As a result, even the earliest versions of Julia were easy for compilers to optimize to C/Fortran efficiency. It's clear that in almost every case Julia is close to C. Where it is not close to C actually has a few details. The first is the Fibonacci problem where Julia is 2.11x from C. This is because it is a test of recursion, and Julia does not fully optimize recursion (but still does very well on this problem!). The optimization which is used to receive the fastest times for this type of problem is known as Tail-Call Optimization. Julia can at any time add this optimization, though [there are reasons](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/4964) why [they choose not to](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/julia-users/tail$20call/julia-users/qHRDj80rIvA/T3AylpjsASEJ). The main reason is: any case where tail-call optimization is possible, a loop can also be used. But a loop is also more robust for optimizations (there are many recursive calls which will fail to tail-call optimize) and thus they want to just recommend using loops instead of using fragile TCO. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other cases where Julia doesn't do as well are the `rand_mat_stat` and the `parse_int` tests. However, this is largely due to a feature known as bounds checking. In most scripting languages, you will receive an error if you try to index an array outside of its bounds. Julia will do this by default:"

    "Because `const` is about types, it acts slightly differently than one would expect. `const` is a declaration that the type of `a` will be constant, not the value. Therefore we can change `a` from 3 to 4 since it goes from an `Int` to an `Int`. However, trying to change `a` to `3.0` fails because it cannot change to a Float64.\n",

    "Julia is fast by design. Type stability and multiple dispatch is necessary to do the specialization that is involved in Julia's compilation to make it work so well. The robust type system is required to make working with types at such a fine level in order to effectively achieve type-stability whenever possible, and manage optimizations when it's not totally possible.\n",
