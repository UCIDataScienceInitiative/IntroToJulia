    \section{A Very Quick Introduction to Git/Github for Julia
Users}\label{a-very-quick-introduction-to-gitgithub-for-julia-users}

Julia's package system and Github are very closely intertwined:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Julia's package management system (METADATA) is a Github repository
\item
  The packages are hosted as Github repositories
\item
  Julia packages are normally referred to with the ending ``.jl''
\item
  Repositories register to become part of the central package management
  by sending a pull request to METADATA.jl
\item
  The packages can be found / investigated at Github.com
\item
  Julia's error messages are hyperlinks to the page in Github
\end{itemize}

Because of this, it's very useful for everyone using Julia to know a
little bit about Git/Github.

    \subsection{Git Basics}\label{git-basics}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Git is a common Version Control System (VCS)
\item
  A project is a \textbf{repository} (repos)
\item
  After one makes changes to a project, they \textbf{commit} the changes
\item
  Changes are \textbf{pulled} to the main repository hosted online
\item
  To download the code, you \textbf{clone} the repository
\item
  Instead of editing the main repository, one edits a \textbf{branch}
\item
  To get the changes of the main branch in yours, you \textbf{fetch},
  \textbf{pull}, or \textbf{rebase}
\item
  One asks the owner of the repository to add their changes via a
  \textbf{pull request}
\item
  Stable versions are cut to \textbf{releases}
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Github Basics}\label{github-basics}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The major online server for git repositories is Github
\item
  Github is a free service
\item
  Anyone can get a Github account
\item
  The code is hosted online, free for everyone to view
\item
  Users can open \textbf{Issues} to ask for features and give bug
  reports to developers
\item
  Many projects are brought together into \textbf{organizations}
  (JuliaMath, JuliaDiffEq, JuliaStats, etc.)
\end{itemize}

An example Github repository for a Julia package is is
DifferentialEquations.jl:
https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl

\item

The badges on a Github repository show you the current state of the
repo. From left to right:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Gitter Badge: Click this to go to a chatroom and directly chat with
  the developers
\item
  CI Build Badges: This tell you whether the CI tests pass. Click on
  them to see what versions of Julia the package works for.
\item
  Coverage: This tells you the percentage of the code that the tests
  cover. If coverage is low, parts of the package may not work even if
  the CI tests pass.
\item
  Docs Badges: Click on these to go to the package documentation.
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Using Julia's Package
Manager}\label{using-julias-package-manager}

\subsubsection{Adding a Package}\label{adding-a-package}

Julia's package manager functions are mirror the Git functions. Julia's
package system is similar to R/Python in that a large number of packages
are freely available. You search for them in places like
\href{http://genieframework.com/packages}{Julia's Package Genie}, or
from the \href{http://pkg.julialang.org/}{Julia Package Listing}. Let's
take a look at the \href{https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl}{Plots.jl
package by Tom Breloff}. To add a package, use \texttt{Pkg.add}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor} }]:} Pkg.update() \PYZsh{} You may need to update your local packages first
        Pkg.add("Plots")
\end{Verbatim}

    This will install the package to your local system. However, this will
only work for registered packages. To add a non-registered package, go
to the Github repository to find the clone URL and use
\texttt{Pkg.clone}. For example, to install the
\texttt{ParameterizedFunctions} package, we can use:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor} }]:} Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ParameterizedFunctions.jl")
\end{Verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Importing a Package}\label{importing-a-package}

To use a package, you have to import the package. The \texttt{import}
statement will import the package without exporting the functions to the
namespace. (Note that the first time a package is run, it will
precompile a lot of the functionality.) For example:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}5}]:} import Plots
        Plots.plot(rand(4,4))
\end{Verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Exporting Functionality}\label{exporting-functionality}

To instead export the functions (of the developers choosing) to the
namespace, we can use the \texttt{using} statement. Since Plots.jl
exports the \texttt{plot} command, we can then use it without reference
to the package that it came from:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}6}]:} using Plots
        plot(rand(4,4))
\end{Verbatim}

    What really makes this possible in Julia but not something like Python
is that namespace clashes are usually avoided by multiple dispatch. Most
packages will define their own types in order to use dispatches, and so
when they export the functionality, the methods are only for their own
types and thus do not clash with other packages. Therefore it's common
in Julia for concise syntax like \texttt{plot} to be part of packages,
all without fear of clashing.

    \subsection{Getting on the Latest
Version}\label{getting-on-the-latest-version}

Since Julia is currently under lots of development, you may wish to
checkout newer versions. By default, \texttt{Pkg.add} is the ``latest
release'', meaning the latest tagged version. However, the main version
shown in the Github repository is usually the ``master'' branch. It's
good development practice that the latest release is kept ``stable'',
while the ``master'' branch is kept ``working'', and development takes
place in another branch (many times labelled ``dev''). You can choose
which branch your local repository takes from. For example, to checkout
the master branch, we can use:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor} }]:} Pkg.checkout("Plots")
\end{Verbatim}

    This will usually gives us pretty up to date features (if you are using
a ``unreleased version of Julia'' like building from the source of the
Julia nightly, you may need to checkout master in order to get some
packages working). However, to go to a specific branch we can give the
branch as another argument:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor} }]:} Pkg.checkout("Plots","dev")
\end{Verbatim}

    This is not advised if you don't know what you're doing (i.e.~talk to
the developer or read the pull requests (PR)), but this is common if you
talk to a developer and they say ``yes, I already implemented that.
Checkout the dev branch and use \texttt{plot(...)}).
